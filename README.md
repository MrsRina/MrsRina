//  me

hello my name is Rina.

i do not have much to talk about, all in my life is insanely dim, but my purpose of making GUIs and GPU-accelerated software makes me wake.  
i started programming in 2018 when I was 13~14 years old, did a lot of minecraft mods, games, and libraries... the time passed.

today i am just a useless graphics programmer, and a waste of time, done for fall into the oblivion.  
i do cpp, openGL, and vulkan...

i love turok, nocase, sneak_case, handmade lighhtweight softwares, open-source, cats, and cows.

// idk

my life most important project:  
[ekg gui library](https://github.com/vokegpu/ekg-ui-library)
