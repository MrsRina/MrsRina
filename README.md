`//  me`

hello my name is rina.

i do not have much to talk about, all in my life is insanely dim, but my purpose of making guis and gpu-accelerated software makes me wake.  
i started programming in 2018 when I was 13~14 years old, i did a lot of minecraft mods, engines, games, and libraries... the time passed.

today i am just a useless graphics programmer, and a waste of time, done for fall into the oblivion.  
i do cpp, opengl, vulkan, and rocm...

`// ref`

i love turok, nocase, sneak_case, handmade lightweight softwares, open-source projects, cats, and cows.

`// idk`

my life most important project:  
[ekg gui library | ekg ui tool-kit](https://github.com/vokegpu/ekg-ui-library)
