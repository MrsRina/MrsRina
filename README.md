Hello my name is Rina.

I do not have much to talk about, all in my life is insanely dim, but my purpose of making GUIs and GPU-accelerated software makes me wake.
I started programming in 2018 when I was 13~14 years old, I did a lot of Minecraft mods, games, and libraries... The time passed.

Today I am just a useless graphics programmer, and waste of time, done for fall into the oblivion.

my most important project life:
