//  me

Hello my name is Rina.

I do not have much to talk about, all in my life is insanely dim, but my purpose of making GUIs and GPU-accelerated software makes me wake.  
I started programming in 2018 when I was 13~14 years old, I did a lot of Minecraft mods, games, and libraries... The time passed.

Today I am just a useless graphics programmer, and a waste of time, done for fall into the oblivion.  
I do C++, OpenGL, and Vulkan...

// idk

my most important project life:  
[ekg gui library](https://github.com/vokegpu/ekg-ui-library)
